# TEK Firmware Upgrade

This is a simple tool that can upgrade the firmware of a [Truly Ergonomic Keyboard](http://trulyergonomic.com).

It has a simple GUI, and runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

For custom keymapping on older models, the firmware can be created using the (old) [Custom Layout Designer online](https://trulyergonomic.com/store/layout-designer--configurator--reprogrammable--truly-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard.html).

## Command-line tool

Note that there is also a open source (GPL) command-line tool which can upgrade the firmware of these keyboards: https://github.com/m-ou-se/teck-programmer
